# SUPER SECRET CONFIDENTIAL ABSOLUTE MONSTER PROJECT

## What is this?

This is a very secret project that the university definitly did not require from us to pass the ICS108 course.

## Why do I care?

That's the neat part, you DON'T.

You should never care about such outdated codebase built on a useless framework from the stone ages.

## Folder Structure

The workspace is completely and flawlessly organized as its obvious, where:

-   `controllers`: contains class controllers for things such as the schedule in the second page.
-   `models`: contains class models, such as Course, Section, and Lecture.
-   `utils`: holds important utility tools for our application.
